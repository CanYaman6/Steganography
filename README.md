# Steganography
Overview
Steganography is the practice of concealing a secret message or data within another non-secret message or data. This can be accomplished by embedding the secret information into various file types, such as images, audio files, or text documents. Unlike encryption, where the existence of the message is obvious, steganography aims to make the hidden information completely undetectable.

Key Features
Data Hiding: Conceal data within images, audio, or text without altering the visible content.
Secure Communication: Protect sensitive information by hiding it within innocuous files.
Multiple Formats: Supports various formats, including PNG, JPEG, BMP, MP3, and WAV.
Easy Extraction: Retrieve hidden messages using specific decoding methods or tools.

Types of Steganography
*Image Steganography
*Audio Steganography
*Text Steganography

Basic Workflow
Prepare the Cover File: Select a file (image, audio, etc.) that will conceal the hidden message.
Insert Hidden Data: Use the steganography tool to encode the secret information into the cover file.
Share the File: Distribute the steganographic file, which contains the hidden data.
Extract the Data: The recipient can use the decoding method to extract the hidden message from the file.
